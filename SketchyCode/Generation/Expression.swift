// Calling this an expression is a bit of an exaggeration. This takes place of
// statements and expressions, and performs minimal modeling by design. The goal
// is to provide a loose modeling that defers variable naming and allows the
// generators to probe dependencies and move expressions for organizational
// purposes.
